    State:
    Zip Code:

    * The text "<script>" and "</script>" are removed server-side to protect against a XSS attack;
      we instead use "<script type="text/javascript>" and "</script >".
    * There is a 45 character limit per field client side; we separated the attack across multiple
      fields.
    * Fields have "<br>" tags inserted between them on the confirmation page; we used javascript
      comments so the javascript engine would ignore them.

C)
  1) service-attack.html and steal.cgi are included.
